Vector Maze is a difficult maze game. Avoid the blue seekers while collecting as many green spinners as possible before finding the exit!

Vector Maze was created as the final project for a high school computer science class. The project assignment goal being to create a game using Java. In the game you control a red ball and navigate the maze to the exit. Along the way the blue seekers must be avoided while collecting as many green spinners as possible.

The game was developed in Java using only the standard library (AWT anyone?). All graphics were done using a JFrame canvas and java drawing primitive operations. Levels are created and stored in a plain text format and loaded at runtime.

Later on after the class I added a pseudo-3D perspective effect for the walls and fixed some remaining issues with the game.
